    abstract={This study presents a scrutiny recognition algorithm based on semantic segmentation techniques to precisely identify rescue targets within obstacle-rich environments using an autonomous flying drone. To effectively process drone imagery captured at high altitudes, we used a real-time semantic segmentation model based on the DeepLabV3+ architecture. The model was optimized to robustly handle image distortion and scale variations arising from changes in flight altitude. The proposed algorithm supports rapid and reliable victim detection, significantly enhancing the efficiency of emergency rescue and search operations across diverse terrains.},
