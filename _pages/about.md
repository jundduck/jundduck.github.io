I am a M.S. student at POSTECH, South Korea, and I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/).

My ultimate goal is to enable machines to understand the world just like humans do. To achieve this, I have been focusing on dataset construction for model training and robustness for real-world applications.

Having served as both a first and second author on research projects, I am open to research collaboration opportunities. If you find my work interesting, please feel free to reach out to me!
