I am an upcoming M.S. student at POSTECH, South Korea, and I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/), who is advising my current research internship as well.

My ultimate goal is to enable machines to understand the world just like humans do. To achieve this, I have participated in research projects on reducing annotation costs for image classification by leveraging active learning and improving the robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for its real-world applicability.

Having served as both a first and second author on research projects, I am open to research collaboration opportunities. If you find my work interesting, please feel free to reach out to me!
