I am an undergraduate student at POSTECH, South Korea, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am also working as a research intern at [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/), POSTECH, under the supervision of Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/).

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. I have worked on reducing the annotation cost for image classification tasks by leveraging active learning and using hand-crafted query strategies. Currently, I am interested in vision foundation models (e.g., SAM) and their robustness and generalization beyond the 2D space.

I am looking for internships and research opportunities in the field of machine learning and computer vision. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to reach out to me!
