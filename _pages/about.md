I am a Undergraduate student at Yonsei University, South Korea.

Hi, I’m an AI researcher passionate about robot world models and navigation. My current focus is on building scalable spatial understanding systems that enable robots to perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments. I’m exploring how neural world models can serve as a foundation for autonomous navigation and decision-making. If you’re also excited about robot intelligence and embodied AI, let’s connect and explore ideas together.


I like the tension and thrill that come with competitions.
